# Playbook drawer

As part of starting a new job I needed to learn PyQt and QML. I started following the NFL 2 years ago and wanted to learn some more about different schemes formations and all that type of stuff. In an effort to make my at-home vacation entertaining thought I make a playdrawer.

## Updates

**22-02-2021**

Intial release! Finally have something on GitHub that is not school related. Application currently parses plays from .jip file (not ego related of course ;)) and displays these in interface. Sidebar has give name of play. When pressing on different play, this one will be loaded.

## **Features I still want to implement**

* [ ] Non text based play creation
* [ ] Support for multiple cut routes (post-corner route or double moves)
* [ ] Pre-snap motion
* [ ] More formations
* [ ] More routes
* [ ] Ability to add own formation names
* [ ] Running plays (As a Browns fan this will get top priority)
* [ ] Different types of protections
* [ ] Quarterback movement
* [ ] Defensive players in offensive plays
* [ ] Ability to make defensive playbooks
